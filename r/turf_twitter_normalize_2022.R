# calculate the normal scores for each category
# I was going to calculate an index with a max of 50
# 5 points for followers
# 5 points for followers/following ratio (but this I omit for now)
# 10 point for favorite h-index
# 10 points for retweets h-index
# 10 points for tweet creation rate
# 10 points for mentions
# however, that doesn't work very well, as the data are so far from normal that a
# few accounts get almost all the points in each category. So I took the PGA Tour
# approach, ranked in each category, and added the ranks
