## Scripts for 2022 Turf Twitter analysis

A summary Shiny app showing the results of these calculations is here: [Turfgrass Twitter 2022](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/turf_twitter_2022/)

These are the scripts and a description of how the calculations are made.

This code is similar to what I first did in the 2017 analysis; you can see that code [here](https://github.com/micahwoods/turf_twitter_2017).
